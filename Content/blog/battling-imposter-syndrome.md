Imposter syndrome is something a lot of companies talk about. It particularly affects newer employees. No matter what validation I get or how high I move up it doesn't ever "go away", but it does get better. 

### Accepting What you Don't Know
The [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) is reasonably well known at this point. It states that those of low ability at a task overestimate their ability and that high performers underestimate their abilities. This makes a lot of sense and can give a little insight into why imposter syndrome travels with you your whole career.

As you begin to learn more about engineering you start to realize just how much you don't know. The industry is so fast-paced that whatever you know today will be seen as outdated in a couple of years anyways. Sure, there are fundamentals that haven't changed, but software is ever-evolving.

To help combat imposter syndrome, start by simply accepting that there is now and will always be a plethora of software engineering knowledge you'll never posess. It's simply not possible for one person to learn all there is.

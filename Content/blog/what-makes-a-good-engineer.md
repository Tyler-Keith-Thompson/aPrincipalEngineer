title: What makes a good engineer?
---

As an engineer working for a company, you'll constantly be measured. Usually in terms of your contribution to the bottom line somewhat obscured through business measurements. Some companies will also try to measure how you are as a team player. Both of these are things companies value, but a great team player that has a measurable positive impact on revenue isn't my definition of a good engineer.

### Drive
Drive is one of my favorite and first measurements. Given a choice between a driven junior engineer and an apathetic senior engineer, I will pick the driven person every single time. Apathy is death for a team, death for a project, death for a career.

It's important to acknowledge that companies can and will take advantage of driven people. If you zone out because you love your job, if you're the kind of person that can't walk away from a problem until you've found a solution, or you spend your spare time trying to hone your craft, then it's a fair bet you'll be exploited at some point. 

Let's try and define "drive" what does it even mean to be a driven engineer? To be driven means that you have a strong, innate urge to accomplish a goal. I don't mean a goal set by a company, I mean a personal goal. Perhaps your goal is as simple as "become a better engineer" or perhaps it's "solve the problem in front of me right now." However, driven individuals all share that strong desire to achieve. I feel obligated to point out what should be obvious you can be a driven individual and still have reasonable boundaries. Driven people don't have to work 10 hour days 7 days a week.

### Problem Solving
A good engineer is somebody who will "figure it out." These are people who will read documentation, people who will experiment with POCs, and people who will step out of their comfort zone to try something new. 

I'll share a story of a team that was frustrating to me as a leader. I tasked them with setting up a 3rd party service for our repo. This team was on a pretty significant multi-hour time delay from me, so any questions would have to wait a day for answers. They ran into their first roadblock; the 3rd party service couldn't find our repo. Then they promptly stopped work and asked me for help. When I saw this question, I did a google search and found a GitHub issue from someone with a similar problem. In that issue, they detailed the GitHub API used to query for repositories wonderful!

Up until this point, I considered it normal interaction. It was mildly annoying that they stopped work, but it gave me a chance to show them *how* to problem-solve these things. However, on receiving the new information on the endpoint used somebody clicked the link in the issue for the API endpoint and, unsurprisingly, got an authentication error. They once again stopped work and asked for my help. This was immensely frustrating as a leader. At this point, we're two days in and I could've done it myself by now. It was also a prime opportunity for feedback. GitHub API authentication is incredibly well documented and our time would be much better spent if they'd read that documentation and experimented a little instead of waiting on me to solve everything.

In your quest to become a good developer, don't be like that team. It's great to ask questions, but stopping when you hit a roadblock is a recipe for disaster. These things are meant to be overcome. Ask yourself if there's a way to get the information with a little research. Research is the lifeblood of any good engineer.

### Strong Opinions
I feel like this post can go on forever so I'll end with the 3rd trait I love to see in a good engineer. I was recently in an interview and asked "How do you deal with strong-willed developers?" My response was that I invite them on my team, I love strong-willed developers. These are the kinds of people who really drive quality and good conversation. 

A former boss of mine had a saying that resonated with many of us, myself included. "Strong opinions, loosely held." This is a wonderful way to think about it, strong opinions are a wonderful addition to a team or project. They can lead to great conversation, they can lead to better quality, and they can lead to healthy collaboration. Problems occur when individuals also strongly hold those opinions and are unwilling to budge.

Everybody has the hills they are willing to die on, but good engineers are capable of changing their mind on strong opinions they have. To be clear, this does not mean to cave. I've worked with people who state an opinion and upon encountering any resistance will back down and become noticeably unhappy and resentful. They still strongly held their opinion, they simply didn't want to have a conversation. This is the beginnings of a toxic team environment and should be avoided. It can be painful to have a conversation until the team has a good conclusion, but good engineers will do just that.
